# Airbnb Clone Project - StayBackend

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Backend Project is a simulation of a real-world property rental platform backend. It focuses on backend development, covering core functionalities like user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. This project aims to build a scalable and secure backend system using modern development practices and technologies.


## üë• Team Roles

### Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing RESTful and GraphQL API endpoints, managing business logic, and integrating the database with the Django framework.

### Database Administrator
Designs the schema, optimizes queries, maintains data integrity, and ensures high availability of the PostgreSQL database.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles Docker setup, CI/CD pipelines, server deployment, monitoring, and ensures the scalability and availability of backend services.

### QA Engineer
Creates and executes tests, identifies bugs, ensures reliability, and validates that the backend meets quality and security standards.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for building scalable backend systems.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools to build RESTful APIs for managing data.
- **GraphQL**: Enables flexible and efficient data querying from the frontend.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database for structured data storage.
- **Celery**: Manages asynchronous tasks such as notifications and email triggers.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to ensure consistent environments.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**: Automates testing, building, and deployment processes.


## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Entities and Key Fields

#### User
- `id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (guest/host)

#### Property
- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `user_id` (FK to User)

#### Booking
- `id`
- `user_id` (FK to User)
- `property_id` (FK to Property)
- `check_in`
- `check_out`

#### Review
- `id`
- `user_id` (FK to User)
- `property_id` (FK to Property)
- `rating`
- `comment`

#### Payment
- `id`
- `booking_id` (FK to Booking)
- `amount`
- `status`
- `payment_method`

### Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Booking** belongs to a **User** and a **Property**.
- A **Payment** is linked to one **Booking**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.


## üîç Feature Breakdown

### User Management
Handles user registration, login, profile management, and authentication via secure endpoints.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to list, update, and delete property listings with complete metadata.

### Booking System
Allows users to book properties for specific dates and manages availability and history.

### Payment Processing
Integrates a secure payment system to process transactions and maintain billing records.

### Review System
Enables users to leave feedback and ratings on properties they've booked.

### API Documentation
Follows the OpenAPI standard for REST and supports GraphQL for flexible data fetching.


## üîê API Security

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Secure login using tokens or sessions (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization**: Restrict access based on user roles (e.g., only hosts can list properties).
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.
- **Data Validation**: Sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks.
- **HTTPS/SSL**: Encrypt all data in transit to protect sensitive user information.

### Why It Matters

- **Protecting User Data**: Prevent data leaks and identity theft.
- **Securing Payments**: Ensure financial transactions are encrypted and verified.
- **Maintaining Trust**: A secure platform builds user trust and brand reliability.


## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Overview
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It ensures every code change is automatically tested, built, and deployed, reducing human errors and increasing release speed.

### Tools
- **GitHub Actions**: Automate test runs, linting, and deployment pipelines.
- **Docker**: Build containerized applications for consistent deployment.
- **Celery + Redis**: Supports background jobs in a microservices-friendly architecture.
